This week I mainly used ChatGPT for my daily use. However I didn't just use it to get answers and get the work done easily. I used it as an assistant for my lectures. I uploaded the slides and asked it to give me a note based summary and it did.
For this class, I mainly used it to give me a refresher on what I learned last semester for INST126. Most of the things I remembered, but what I asked it to give me a better recap on were boolean commands.
