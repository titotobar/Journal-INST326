This week I mainly used ChatGPT for my daily use. However I didn't just use it to get answers and get the work done easily. I used it as an assistant for my lectures. I uploaded the slides and asked it to give me a note based summary and it did.
For this class, I mainly used it to give me a refresher on what I learned last semester for INST126. Most of the things I remembered, but what I asked it to give me a better recap on were boolean commands.

WEEK 2:
This week I used ChatGPT to help me do my lab exercises. I have a rule that I never ask chat for the answers directly, but instead I ask it to guide me step by step on how to get the answer. For example I asked it to go step by step for number 30. I also ask it to give me more practice problems so that I can practice and get the hang of Python.
WEEK 3:
This week I used AI to guide me step bye step with my work, but I didn't ask it for the answers (only when I was really stuck).
WEEK 4: This week I didn't use AI. The assignments were really easy.

WEEK 5: 
This week I only used AI to get our project to push to github which was pretty complicated.

WEEK 6:
This week was relatively moderate in terms of the assignments. I had to use a little bit of AI to get through but like always, never a direct answer and more of a step-by-ste4p guide.

WEEk 7:
This week I felt more guilty of using AI due to stress and extracurriculars going on. I tried to not use it this week but unfortunately, I had to use some because I had so many other assignments and exams.

WEEK 8:
I used AI for most of my assignment this week.

WEEK 9:
I used AI for some assignments but I did try to utalize it specifically for studying.
